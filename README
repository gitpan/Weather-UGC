Weather::UGC is a module for parsing Universal Generic Code (UGC) lines
in National Weather Service (NWS) products.

The current version does minimal validation of zone names only: it does
not check if the state or the zone in a particular state is valid, nor
does it check if the expiration field refers to a valid day of the month
or time.
